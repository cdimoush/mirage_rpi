# mirage_rpi

As I write this mirage as been dead for about a year. I put enough mental energy into this project for it to deserve a proper tombstone. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here lies Mirage. In the the height of my IOT and homeautomation 'phase' I thought up seemless GUI to serve as a control panel for other project, devices, and well life. I was tired of Alexa and wanted a tactile and visual medium to automate simple taskes. Mirage was to exist on a raspberry pi, be desplayed on a small flat screen, and recieve input from a hacked bluetooth wii nunchuck.

While, multiple python libraries were tested for the GUI Kivy was selected. Kivy has many features but has its own unique language. This language is not required so I resisted. This only made development harder. The kivy library is also large so the poor raspberry pi ran extremely slow.

In the hight of the project Mirage was able to turn on/off a stereo, christmas light, and change LED light colors through and 8 channel relay. The bluetooth connection had a nasty tendency to drop so I had to settle for keyboard control over bluetooth.

Long story short Mirage was excatly that of its name. Mirage was a distant goal, a shimmer of light, a false reality. 

RIP
